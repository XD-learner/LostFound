<h1>Digital Lost And Found Management System</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<b>How It Works</b>:<br>
Institutions register directly on the system.<br>
All data (lost and found reports) is managed in a centralized database.<br>
Users interact with the centralized system, regardless of the institution where the item was lost or found.<br>
<h2>Entire Process: </h2><br>
<b>1. User Reports a Lost Item</b><br>
<p>User submits a Lost Item Report via the system. This report includes details like item description, image (if available), and the location where the item was lost.<br>
The system receives and reformats the report data for easier processing.</p><br>
2. System Analyzes Report Data<br>
Context Analysis with NLP: The system processes the textual description provided by the user using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand key details about the lost item.<br>
Image Recognition: If the user uploads an image of the lost item, the system uses image recognition to extract features and match it with existing database records.<br>
These two processes (NLP and Image Recognition) help create a search query for the next step.<br>
3. Search Database for Matching Items<br>
The system queries the Lost Item Database and the Found Item Database to check for any items that match the search criteria (based on item description, location, and image).<br>
Found Item Report: If a matching item is found, the system notifies the User and checks the Item Verification Status.<br>
4. Item Verification<br>
Institution Verification: Once a match is found, the Institution (such as a Lost and Found department) verifies whether the found item is indeed the lost item.<br>
The institution updates the Item Verification Status.<br>
5. Item Return Process<br>
User Chooses Return Method: The user can choose to either self-pickup the item from the institution or request it to be shipped.<br>
The system captures this Return Method selection.<br>
The Institution handles the return by either coordinating pickup or shipping based on the userâ€™s choice.<br>
6. Update Lost Item Report Status<br>
After the item is returned to the rightful owner, the Lost Item Report Status is updated in the system to reflect that the item has been successfully returned.<br>
7. User Reports a Found Item<br>
If a User finds an item, they can submit a Found Item Report using the system, providing similar information (description, image, and location).<br>
This report goes through the same processing as a Lost Item Report: reformatting, context analysis, image recognition, and searching the database.<br>
8. Institution Registration and Management<br>
Institutions need to register on the platform to be able to verify and handle found or lost item reports.<br>
The System Administrator oversees institution registrations, ensuring proper data and process management.<br>
