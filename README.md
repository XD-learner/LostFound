<h1>Digital Lost And Found Management System</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<b>How It Works</b>:<br>
Institutions register directly on the system.<br>
All data (lost and found reports) is managed in a centralized database.<br>
Users interact with the centralized system, regardless of the institution where the item was lost or found.<br>
<h2>Entire Process</h2><br>
. User Reports a Lost Item
User submits a Lost Item Report via the system. This report includes details like item description, image (if available), and the location where the item was lost.
The system receives and reformats the report data for easier processing.
2. System Analyzes Report Data
Context Analysis with NLP: The system processes the textual description provided by the user using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand key details about the lost item.
Image Recognition: If the user uploads an image of the lost item, the system uses image recognition to extract features and match it with existing database records.
These two processes (NLP and Image Recognition) help create a search query for the next step.
3. Search Database for Matching Items
The system queries the Lost Item Database and the Found Item Database to check for any items that match the search criteria (based on item description, location, and image).
Found Item Report: If a matching item is found, the system notifies the User and checks the Item Verification Status.
4. Item Verification
Institution Verification: Once a match is found, the Institution (such as a Lost and Found department) verifies whether the found item is indeed the lost item.
The institution updates the Item Verification Status.
5. Item Return Process
User Chooses Return Method: The user can choose to either self-pickup the item from the institution or request it to be shipped.
The system captures this Return Method selection.
The Institution handles the return by either coordinating pickup or shipping based on the userâ€™s choice.
6. Update Lost Item Report Status
After the item is returned to the rightful owner, the Lost Item Report Status is updated in the system to reflect that the item has been successfully returned.
7. User Reports a Found Item
If a User finds an item, they can submit a Found Item Report using the system, providing similar information (description, image, and location).
This report goes through the same processing as a Lost Item Report: reformatting, context analysis, image recognition, and searching the database.
8. Institution Registration and Management
Institutions need to register on the platform to be able to verify and handle found or lost item reports.
The System Administrator oversees institution registrations, ensuring proper data and process management.
