<h1>Digital Lost And Found Management System</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<b>How It Works</b>:
Institutions register directly on your system.
All data (lost and found reports) is managed in a centralized database.
Users interact with the centralized system, regardless of the institution where the item was lost or found.
